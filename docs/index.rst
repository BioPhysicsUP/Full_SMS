Full SMS Documentation
========================================

This is the documentation for the software Full SMS, which is used to view and analyse single-molecule fluorescence
meausurements. Specifically, time-tagged time-resolved measurements on single particles can be analysed to extract
intensity levels and to fit fluorescence lifetimes. The software also has functionality to view and export raster
scan images and spectral time traces and perform second-order cross-correlations.
