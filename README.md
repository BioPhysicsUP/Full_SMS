An analysis suite developed by the Biophysics Group at the University of Pretoria, South Africa.

### Main Features

- Performs change point analysis to resolve intensity levels of fluorescence measurements
- Uses Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to group resolved levels
- Performs fluorescence decay fitting to measure lifetimes

### Known limitations/problems

- Inability to close measurement file once opened
- Some systems may encounter missing numxpr module

### Planned Improvements

- Global Grouping
- Improved stability
- Additional conversion tools

### Additional Info
