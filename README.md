A graphical user interface-based analysis suite developed by the Biophysics Group at the University of Pretoria, South 
Africa.

### Main Features

- Performs change point analysis to resolve brightness levels of fluorescence measurements.
- Uses Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering to group resolved levels.
- Performs fluorescence decay fitting to measure lifetimes.
- Allows filtering and export of analysed brightness/lifetime data.
- Computes second-order correlation functions from time-tagged photon data.
- Displays raster scan images and fluorescence spectral time traces.

### Known limitations/problems

- Inability to close measurement file once opened.
- Some systems may encounter missing numxpr module.

### Planned Improvements

- Improved stability.
- Additional conversion tools.
- Additional analysis functionality, such as for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.
